## Research profile
Our research focuses on the study of information processing across networks of neurons, with emphasis on the neuronal mechanisms that underlie learning and memory formation. By recording the simultaneous activity of large numbers of neurons in freely behaving animals, we study the structure of the interactions between the hippocampus and neocortical brain areas and the role of these interactions in learning and memory.
